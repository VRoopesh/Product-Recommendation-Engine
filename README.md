Just a few Amazon related facts:

They lost $4.8 million in August 2013, when their website went down for 40 mins. They hold the patent on 1-Click buying, and licenses it to Apple. Their Phoenix fulfilment centre is a massive 1.2 million square feet. Amazon relies heavily on a Recommendation engine that reviews customer ratings and purchase history to recommend items and improve sales.

This is a dataset related to over 2 Million customer reviews and ratings of Beauty related products sold on their website.

It contains

the unique UserId (Customer Identification),

the product ASIN (Amazon's unique product identification code for each product),

Ratings (ranging from 1-5 based on customer satisfaction) and

the Timestamp of the rating (in UNIX time)

This dataset contains product reviews and metadata from Amazon, including 142.8 million reviews spanning May 1996 - July 2014.

This dataset includes reviews (ratings, text, helpfulness votes), product metadata (descriptions, category information, price, brand, and image features), and links (also viewed/also bought graphs).
